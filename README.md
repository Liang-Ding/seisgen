# seisgen
The SEISGEN is a python package to generate synthetic seismic waveform by utilizing the stored receiver-side Strain Green's Tensor (SGT) database that is created by using [the python script](https://github.com/Liang-Ding/pyCAPLunar/blob/master/DSEM_Utils/merge_strainfield.py) in the project [pyCAPLunar](https://github.com/Liang-Ding/pyCAPLunar) to merge the strain-filed data that is written out by the SPECFEM3D package upon the waveform simulation in the 3D background model.
